## My Experiences

### Kubernetes and backend

For a year, I worked on a Cache Delivery Network optimized for broadcasting videos. The app was brought from a monolithic sofware to ✨microservices✨ just before I joined the project  

I refactored parts of the `operator` of the app, edited the **helms chart**, implemented some features from the frontend to the core. I learnt good practices and encountered bad implementation choices.

### Software developing

During a year and half, I was in a team implementing a video encoder in C++. The main focus was performance⏱, as this would result on more channel being encoded at the time.

My linux🐧 skills contributed a lot on this project, as I worked on the ISO💿 used to install the software and the docker🐋 container used for PoC

### Scrum master

When I was a developer at Anevia/Ateme, I had the opportunity to become the Scrum Master of a team of 8 person👯 for 2 years. Those responsabilities told me a lot about finding compromises to make the management and the team working together.🤲

This experience made me very implicated on the different ways of doing Scrum, Kanban, or any other method in between.🗺️
